                              BUG 7
<================================================================>
problem: Page fault was not being reached for edge cases in page testing

fix: There was a stack imbalance in our asm routine for enabling
     the paging because of a stack imbalance at the beginning

                              BUG 6
<================================================================>
problem: General protection fault thrown after typing first char
into keyboard.

fix: Before we were simply cli() before doing the keyboard logic.
We cleared and saved the flags which allowed the RTC to keep interrupting
the keyboard, preventing the exception from being thrown.

                              BUG 5
<================================================================>
problem: General protection fault thrown before keyboard press.

fix: Initially the bounds for which we mapped the input to the set_2_table
were incorrect -- we were initially checking that the user input was greater 
than or equal to 0. This allowed the putc(0) to occur, which throws 
an exception. We changed the bounds to >= 2 and this prevented this 
exception from occuring

                              BUG 4
<================================================================>
problem: The real-time-clock test was only displaying the image once
rather than updating every time the rtc_handler was invoked

fix: Initially we were not looping when calling test_interrupts() which means 
that the video memory was only being updated once, not every time the 
real-time-clock interrupt handler was firing off. Putting this video memory
update call in a while loop allowed the changes in the real-time-clock to
be reflected. We also fixed the PIC logic to initialize the master
PIC first and the slave PIC second rather than interweaving that logic.

                              BUG 3
<================================================================>
problem: Text-mode images were not showing up on the screen when the 
RTC handler was invoked.

fix: We realized that the RTC interrupt handler was being invoked independently
but we were never reflecting the changes made by the RTC in the video memory.
After adding a test_interrupts() call these changes were reflected ultimately.

                              BUG 2
<================================================================>
problem: The struct fields for the page directory and page table entries 
were not being recognized by the compiler.

fix: We linked the types.h to the paging script which ensured that the types
were recognized by the compiler

                              BUG 1
<================================================================>
problem: The assembly script for enabling paging 
         was not being recognized by the compiler

fix: We realized that because the scripts had the same name (page.c and page.S),
     the compiler was writing them to the same object, so we renamed page.S to
     paging.S
